# protein-synthesis-project

The code I wrote will take the text from a file if the file exists and see if it constitutes a valid DNA sequence. Then, the code will convert the DNA sequence into an RNA
sequence and see where the first instance of the string 'AUG' is. At the first index after the string 'AUG' appears, the code will create a string representing the amino acid
sequence that makes up the RNA sequence. Additionally, I also wrote code that takes a large DNA sequence and a small DNA sequence and returns the number of times the small DNA
sequence is repeated in a row in the large DNA sequence.

I have also submitted a file called "proteintest.txt" that is called in my main function. This text file has the code for the DNA sequence to RNA sequence to amino acid sequence 
code to work correctly. 

To run my code, the file "proteintest.txt" must be downloaded, and you have to call main(). That's it.

To the best of my knowledge, this code contains no bugs or issues.
